Description and features
SnapTimer is a simple, free, portable countdown timer for Windows.

All the timers I tested were too complex for my taste.  I decided to write one that was dead simple, so you could run it, type in a time and hit enter.  The aim of SnapTimer is to get out of the way and help you be productive.  It's fast, lightweight and simple to use, but powerful too.

A popular productivity strategy is to use a timer to do mini-sprints of work.  Using SnapTimer I've increased my productivity and reduced procrastination.  It's easier to get yourself to work on a difficult task for 5 minutes because there's a known end point.

* Simple, clean interface
* Displays time in the taskbar, as a hint in the tray and even in the right-click menu of the tray icon.
* Tray icons indicate the mode of the timer (running, paused, completed)
* Multiple alert types - message box, tray icon popup, audio file and any application
* Stopwatch mode when you set minutes to 0
* Play an optional ticking sound while the timer is running
* Countdown can be paused and restarted, or reset
* Portable (runs from your USB flash drive)
* Can stay on top of other windows
* No install required
* Low RAM usage
* Can automatically start counting down immediately
* Includes over 20 loop-friendly alarm sounds (Meaning they'll play over and over until you reset the timer)
* Can automatically restart timer when it finishes
* Lets you quickly and easily change the countdown time with mouse or keyboard shortcuts
* Automatically saves all settings (optional)
* Accepts time as command line argument, so you can create preset timer shortcuts or run the timer from a launcher (FARR, Launchy).
* Can be minimized to tray
* Supports multiple instances (You should disable always on top and probably autosave settings as well)
* Can be docked to a corner, in the center or restore the last screen location
* No internet access required
* Doesn't write to your registry
* No ads, spyware or malware
* 100% free

Unzip SnapTimer.zip and run SnapTimer.exe

Tips
* When the program starts, type the number of minutes (or leave the default),
    then press Enter to start the countdown
* To pause / reset the countdown:
    Click the start / pause button
    Click the tray icon
    Click on the timer numerals
* Double-click on the timer numerals to reset the countdown
* Use the arrow keys to increase or decrease the number of minutes by multiples of 5
* Use the Escape (Esc) key to exit the program
* Set the minutes to 0 to count up

Known issues
* When window is maximized and a dialog (about or options), is opened and closed, the window is un-maximized
* On Windows XP the font color in the font chooser is set to black if the font is using a custom color.
* Always on top mode isn't entirely foolproof, sometimes windows can get above SnapTimer.
* When automatically restart timer and the display message alarm settings are both enabled, the timer is restarted only after the message dialog is dismissed.
