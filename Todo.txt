What to do when time is up
    Blink the time
    Shake the window http://delphi.about.com/od/adptips2005/qt/windowshake.htm (set how many seconds)
    Bring app to front
    Play system beep (MessageBeep(-1); in MMSystem, http://sheepdogguides.com/dt2g.htm
    Restart or shutdown windows (they can already do this by running a command)
    Flip colors of background and foreground

Option to restore defaults (equivalent of deleting the .ini file)

Implement compact mode / mini - show just the time without buttons or menus
    Always on top
    Have progress bar
    Show time in small font
    Have setting so it opens in that mode.
    Write directly on the desktop? http://www.delphitricks.com/source-code/graphic/draw_directly_to_the_desktop.html

Keyboard shortcuts
    Global shortcut to show window (configurable)
    p to pause
    r to reset
    
More command line arguments, like the alarm, auto start, etc.  Add a parameter to use different .ini files.
    Formats of command lines to accept:

Allow creation of saved settings for timers - alarm method and countdown time
Different .ini file for each setting, load the ini file from command line?
Instead of storing the values in a single .ini, read the .ini for settings and alarms separately, and have the main one tell you where to read it from
Then have a dropdown in the options that shows the names of the ini files (without the .ini) for the various sessions.
Provide save as option to save .ini files

Alarm option to kill a running task

Is there a way to not need to have it run as administrator to write to the .ini file?  If it's not in Program Files, it shouldn't need to

Allow setting of hours or seconds as an option?

Change the text to look like a digital clock instead of plain text
    Use images for the numbers? 
    Draw the numbers on a canvas
    It would keep text from shifting slightly when a 1 goes in the minutes' tens place.  If that bothers you, use a monospace font

Add an analog mode that shows a clock face and draw the hands going around

Test with different font sizes (huge fonts, small fonts)

Add progress bar that counts down until it's done

Steve Pavlina's newsletter to do 15 minute chunks
30 minutes of uninterrupted work for the Now Habit
2 minutes of relaxing to get ready for a task

Make stopwatch mode show tenths of seconds instead of just seconds?
Have option to show tenths of seconds for timer mode too

Look at http://gtd-timer.com/moreinfo.htm for settings and ideas

Big screen view: http://www.portablefreeware.com/?id=1920&ts=1280016601

Make it an option to hide the menu bar

Fix settings dialog to look okay with large text (best practice for that sort of thing?)

Play other audio files in addition to wavs

Create themes to choose from (color combinations that look good)

Run notifications at a certain clock time instead of when the timer reaches 0

Make dialogs not show up in taskbar (so nothing appears if the main form is minimized to tray and you open about page or options) I set ShowInTaskBar to stNever, but it still shows up.

When font size changes, automatically resize the window using the viewable rectangle to show all the text.  If I set the form's AutoSize to true, it works on startup (but could use some tweaks), but I can't seem to get it to work after the options dialog is displayed.  What about creating a simple example to see if I can get it to resize the form?  What about using vector graphics?
What about drawing with the font?
I can set the width of the window, and I should be able to get the length of the text - make sure there is enough space to show all the text.

Change start/pause images into an image list TImageList - resizing seems to be messing this up a bit, so it would be good to do

Maximize window and display about or options dialogs, window should remain maximized after dialog is closed.

If custom location is going to be off the screen, ignore the location and go with default of centered

Write unit tests - fpcunit module has Junit-like syntax

* Automatic resize with font change - if it proves too challenging, what about drawing the fonts on a canvas? (post on lazarus forum for help, resize works on startup, how can I get it to work after font size change?)
* Get rid of flickering of the menu when timer is started/stopped or window is resized.  Why is it getting redrawn?

Answer from forum: http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/Developing_with_Graphics#Create_a_custom_control_which_draws_itself
You can draw your clock-style digits with narrow hexagons (TCanvas.Polygon)

What about writing text on a canvas to dynamically size?

Turn README into a CHM file (at least the content section)
Add screenshots 
use chmcmd.exe from c:\lazarus\fpc\2.4.0\bin\i386-win32

Snarl support
http://www.fullphat.net/

Option to start the program minimized

Option to change the window title

Host the files on Google Code as another mirror (link to them, add to release steps to update those files)

Find out why Windows-Home shortcut in Win7 (minimize all other windows) doesn't work when focused on SnapTimer - low priority

Snap to edges (as an option?)

Compile for Linux - besides opening links (which we could do without on Linux), other windows-specific calls are playing audio.  Find method to play audio on Linux (or cross platform solution that works for more kinds of audio files)

Update the time in the tooltip as you hover over the tray icon

Add option to close to tray when you hit escape or close button
Add option to not close when Esc is hit.

Support parsing times on the command line (3.5, 3:15, 3m15s)

Rework the code to use Model, View, Controller

Add a license (GPLv3?)

Defect: Set to remember position but this only works when closing and reopening the program.  It should work on minimize and restore from system tray. To reproduce set to minimize to tray and remember position. Move window somewhere, minimize, then right click tray icon and hit show application. application reappears at place it was opened to instead of place it was minimized from.  Windows 7

Have an option to continue counting down once the timer hits zero so people can see how much time passed since the alarm

Add way to make Snaptimer start with Windows

Updates
 Integrate with DonationCoder's update checker
 Add option in Help menu to check for updates
 Some other way to check for updates

Set a time to display alarm instead of a countdown time (can still do the countdown, just based on the countdown time instead of a fixed set of minutes)

Add command-line parameter support to accept hh:mm:ss, mm:ss, and just seconds rather than minutes?

Add a /start parameter so the .ini would not have to be configured with AutoStart=1 if it is only needed on occasion

Allow parameters to be specified in the "Run program" field, for example: "C:/Program Files/Windows NT/Accessories/wordpad.exe" document.rtf

Add .ini option to not create a tray icon

Add support for a series of named alarms (so you could do 10 minutes on, 5 minutes for a break, etc) and be able to chain them together in any order and cycle through them automatically - making it work better for pomodoro method

Option to stop a repeating alarm after some number of cycles or certain period of time

Be able to enter seconds with minutes - 1.5 or 1:5 would be 1:30

Timer isn't accurate (tested against iPod timer and it was a few seconds slow) - create separate thread for timer?  Use TFPTimer instead (more accurate?) http://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/fcl/fptimer/tfptimer.html How do I set the event for it when it's not found in the GUI? - It's in the LFM file but I when I added it manually it couldn't find the unit.  Add the unit somehow to Lazarus?  Could also look at the code in fptimer.pp http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4562598/tfptimer-not-ticking
https://forums.codegear.com/thread.jspa?messageID=59018&tstart=0
https://forums.embarcadero.com/thread.jspa?messageID=175226&#175226 Instead of using ttimer alone, set time to stop
Set interval to 500ms, when user hits start, set the time to end, then in countdown see if current time is higher than time to stop
http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/EpikTimer - it's in there, just need to try it out

What about stopwatch mode?  That's still inaccurate, but I can't use a fixed time - how do I get that to work?

Make about page a unit that can be included for other apps (like SnapMD5)

Let user set (and display) the target time (like an alarm clock)

Show time updating in tooltip (or another small window that appears when you mouse over the tray icon, like tomighty

Add option to only allow one instance

Set shortcut to start minimized, but app still opens w/o being minimized

Make color of alarm in systray less pink, more red
